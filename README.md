# Criminal Identification System

## Description

This project is a **Criminal Identification System** that uses **Machine Learning** and **Computer Vision** techniques to detect and recognize criminals from surveillance camera footage. The system integrates **OpenCV**, **MongoDB**, and **Tkinter** to provide a user-friendly interface for managing and identifying criminal records.

## Features

- **Face Detection & Recognition**: Uses OpenCV and machine learning models for facial recognition.
- **Database Integration**: Stores criminal data and images in MongoDB.
- **Real-Time Surveillance**: Detects faces from live camera feeds and matches them against the database.
- **GUI Interface**: A Tkinter-based interface for easy management of criminal records.
- **Data Logging & Retrieval**: Allows adding, updating, and retrieving criminal details from the database.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
